# Vulnerability Management Project

## Overview
This project exemplifies a structured approach to Vulnerability Management, encompassing the entire lifecycle from discovery to verification. It was conducted on a VMware Fusion virtual machine hosted on a Windows environment. The project involved installing deprecated software (an old version of Firefox), performing vulnerability scans using Nessus Essentials, and implementing automated software updates. Through meticulous execution, critical vulnerabilities were identified, prioritized, assessed, reported, remediated, and verified.

## Project Details

### 1. Discover

#### Environment Setup and Software Installation
- **VMware Fusion Setup:**
  - Created and configured a virtual machine environment on VMware Fusion hosted on a Windows platform.
  - Installed deprecated software: an outdated version of Firefox, to simulate vulnerable conditions.

### 2. Prioritize

#### Vulnerability Scanning and Prioritization
- **Nessus Essentials Deployment:**
  - Configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans on the virtual machine.
  - Prioritized vulnerabilities based on severity ratings and potential impact on the virtual machine's security.

### 3. Assess

#### Detailed Assessment
- **Vulnerability Assessment:**
  - Conducted in-depth assessments of identified vulnerabilities to understand their exploitability and potential risks.
  - Verified vulnerabilities related to deprecated software and potential system vulnerabilities.

### 4. Report

#### Reporting and Documentation
- **Comprehensive Reports:**
  - Generated detailed reports outlining vulnerability findings, remediation recommendations, and security posture insights.
  - Documented assessment results and vulnerabilities prioritized for remediation.

### 5. Remediate

#### Remediation Actions
- **Immediate Remediation:**
  - Addressed critical vulnerabilities promptly through effective remediation actions.
  - Applied necessary patches, updates, and security configurations to mitigate identified risks.

### 6. Verify

#### Verification of Remediation
- **Validation Processes:**
  - Verified successful remediation of vulnerabilities to ensure they were effectively mitigated.
  - Conducted post-remediation checks and tests to confirm the elimination of identified vulnerabilities.

### Implementation of Automated Software Updates
- **Automation Strategy:**
  - Established automated processes for software updates to maintain continuous protection against emerging vulnerabilities.
  - Integrated automated workflows to streamline the deployment of security patches and updates, reducing manual intervention and minimizing downtime.

## Results
This project achieved significant milestones:
- Identification and prioritization of critical vulnerabilities associated with deprecated software, including the old version of Firefox.
- Execution of thorough vulnerability assessments to understand exploitability and potential risks.
- Implementation of effective remediation measures that strengthened the virtual machine's security posture.
- Verification of remediation actions to ensure vulnerabilities were successfully mitigated.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in Vulnerability Management by adhering to a structured approach that encompasses discovery, prioritization, assessment, reporting, remediation, and verification. The integration of Nessus Essentials for vulnerability scanning and automated software updates underscored my commitment to proactive security practices and continuous improvement. This experience equips me with the skills and insights to contribute effectively to enhancing cybersecurity measures within your organization.
